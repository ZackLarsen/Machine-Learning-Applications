He was raised with help from his grandfather, who served in Patton's army, and his grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management at a bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter working his way through college with the help of scholarships and student loans, President Obama moved to Chicago, where he worked with a group of churches to help rebuild communities devastated by the closure of local steel plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went on to attend law school, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. Upon graduation, he returned to Chicago to help lead a voter registration drive, teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago, and remain active in his community.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Obama's years of public service are based around his unwavering belief in the ability to unite people around a politics of purpose. In the Illinois State Senate, he passed the first major ethics reform in 25 years, cut taxes for working families, and expanded health care for children and their parents. As a United States Senator, he reached across the aisle to pass groundbreaking lobbying reform, lock up the world's most dangerous weapons, and bring transparency to government by putting federal spending online.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was elected the 44th President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009.

people.</p><p>At the <a href=\"https://nyansapofest.wordpress.com/\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">Nyansapo Festival</a> in July, billed as \"blackfeminist\", 80% of the venue will be reserved for black women.</p><p>Black people of any gender will be allowed in another area, while a third area will be open to all.</p><p>Anne Hidalgo tweeted that she reserved the right \"to prosecute the organisers for discrimination\".</p><p>Some French anti-racism organisations have condemned the festival.</p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" class=\"bbccom_slot mpu-ad\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\\n    <div

be turning in her grave.\"</p><p>On Friday the regional head of the far-right National Front party had challenged Ms Hidalgo to explain the \"blatantly racist\" event.</p><p>The organisers said <a href=\"https://www.lagenerale.fr/?p=9208\" class=\"story-body__link-external\">in a statement</a> (in French) that they had been \"the target of a campaign of disinformation and fake news orchestrated by the extreme right\" and they were \"saddened to see some anti-racist associations let themselves be manipulated\".</p><p>They continued by mentioning that many had \"no problem\" with women-only feminist groups when race was not stipulated.</p><p>The festival is scheduled to take place in a property owned by the city of Paris, but the restricted event is in a public area. Organisers said the mayor subsequently had no jurisdiction over the event.</p>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n                                                                                            <div

      "The President today announced a new initiative that will bring\n",

      "communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\n",

      "telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n",
      "\n",
      "For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\n",
      "private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the\n",
      "tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\n",
      "protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\n",
      "the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n",
      "law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\n",
      "industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\n",
      "protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\n",
      "protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\n",
      "technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\n",
      "unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\n",
      "by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n",
      "been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\n",
      "new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\n",
      "relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\n",
      "an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\n",
      "using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\n",
      "commercial use today.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n",

      "Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\n",
      "government officials with legal authorization to conduct a\n",

      "new authorities to access the content of the private\n",
      "conversations of Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\n",
      "Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\n",
      "devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\n",
      "government will be offered access to the confidential details of\n",

      "communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law\n",

      "For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our\n",

      "tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of\n",
      "protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate\n",
      "the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\n",
      "law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\n",
      "industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n",

      "Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\n",

      "A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\n",

      "\n",
      "This new technology will help companies protect proprietary\n",
